## Assignment 07: Files and Exceptions 

The seventh module focused on creating scripts using Files and Exceptions.

### Preparing for Assignment

In preparation for completing the assignment, I followed the Assignment04.docx step by step to gather an understanding of the following:
a.	Working with text files: read, append, combined modes
b.	Working with binary files
c.	Structured error handling using try and except
d.	Using the structured error handling to catch and read errors
e.	GitHub pages

In order to do so, I reviewed the module video, the references and websites. I also reviewed the textbook material.

### Performing the Assignment
I followed the instructions to create the Folders in the C: drive and creating the Assignment starter script. In addition, I installed PyCharm and followed the directions to setup the environment and directory. I tried to use comments in script to remind myself about the organization and purpose of the code. I also watched the videos for the class to get an understanding of what is expected. I finally finished the assignment by uploading to GitHub.
I updated my assignment after reviewing the Assignment module.

#### Create Python script

I created the Python script using the PyCharm IDE. I tried to add comments to explain the code as well.

Utilizing the notes from the TA session and understanding how use Classes and Functions, I was able to complete the code.
I had to also review the Assignment answer to update my work.

#### Test Script
I tested the script within the IDE using the ‘Run’ function. The script executed successfully. The test also output the text file.
Below is a PDF output of the “Run” window results from PyCharm. I ran it twice to check the error handling as well as a good input.

#### Run Script
Once I was confident enough, I opened the Command Prompt in Windows and ran the script.

My code works as intended.
